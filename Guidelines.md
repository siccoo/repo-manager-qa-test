#### **Task Overview**

You are tasked with designing and executing a test strategy for a hypothetical “Repository Management” web application. The application includes key functionalities such as repository creation, issue tracking, pull request handling, and user management.

---

#### **Task Components**

1. **Test Plan & Strategy**
   - **Scope:** Describe the functionalities to be tested (e.g., repository creation, editing, deletion, issue creation, commenting, pull request workflow, user permissions).
   - **Test Types:** Identify and explain the types of testing you will perform (e.g., functional, regression, integration, UI/UX, security, performance).
   - **Test Environment:** Define what environments you would set up (development, staging, production) and any specific test data requirements.
2. **Test Case Design**
   - Write detailed test cases for at least two key user flows. For example:
     - **Repository Creation:** Steps from logging in, filling out repository details, creating the repository, and verifying its creation.
     - **Issue Management:** Steps for creating an issue, adding comments, assigning labels, and closing an issue.
   - Your test cases should include:
     - Pre-conditions
     - Test steps
     - Expected results
     - Post-conditions
   - You can provide these as a table or in a structured document.
3. **Automation Approach**
   - Describe which tests you would automate and why.
   - Provide a sample automated test script (in a language of your choice, e.g., Python with Selenium, JavaScript with Cypress) that verifies one critical functionality (for instance, the repository creation flow).
   - Explain your choice of framework and any considerations for maintainability.
4. **Bug Reporting & Tracking**
   - Describe your process for logging, tracking, and verifying bug fixes.
   - Optionally, include a sample bug report template you would use to document an issue.
5. **Additional Considerations**
   - Discuss how you would incorporate CI/CD into your QA process.
   - Outline how you would manage tests for new features versus regression tests.
   - Mention any performance or security testing strategies you consider important for this application.

  - The test plan and strategy.
  - Detailed test cases.
  - The automation sample script.
  - Documentation of your bug reporting approach.
- Clear instructions on how to run your automated test script (if applicable).
