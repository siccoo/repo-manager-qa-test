# Repository Management Web Application - Test Strategy

## 1. Test Plan & Strategy

### Scope
```
The test plan covers the following key functionalities:

- Repository Management: Creation, editing, deletion of repositories.
- Issue Tracking: Creating, commenting, labeling, and closing issues.
- Pull Requests: Creating, reviewing, merging, and closing pull requests.
- User Management: Registration, login, role-based permissions.
```

### Test Types
```
- Functional Testing: Verify individual features work as expected.
- Integration Testing: Ensure modules interact correctly (e.g., issue comments updating in real-time).
- Regression Testing: Confirm new changes do not break existing functionality.
- UI/UX Testing: Assess usability, responsiveness, and accessibility.
- Security Testing: Validate user authentication, access control, and data protection.
- Performance Testing: Load testing for repository search and issue tracking.
```

### Test Environment
```
- Development: Local testing with mock data.
- Staging: Pre-production environment with real-like data.
- Production: Only for monitoring and incident response.
- Test Data: Sample repositories, users, and issues for validation.
```

## 2. Test Case Design

### Test Case 1: Repository Creation

| Step No. | Test Step                                               | Expected Result                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1        | Navigate to the login page and enter valid credentials. | User is logged in.                |
| 2        | Click on "New Repository".                              | Repository creation form appears. |
| 3        | Fill in repository name, description, and visibility.   | Inputs are accepted.              |
| 4        | Click "Create".                                         | Repository is created and listed. |
| 5        | Navigate to the repository page.                        | Repository details are displayed. |

### Test Case 2: Issue Management

| Step No. | Test Step                                   | Expected Result                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1        | Navigate to an existing repository.         | Repository page is loaded.        |
| 2        | Click on "New Issue".                       | Issue creation form appears.      |
| 3        | Enter issue title, description, and labels. | Inputs are accepted.              |
| 4        | Click "Submit Issue".                       | Issue is created and listed.      |
| 5        | Add a comment to the issue.                 | Comment appears below the issue.  |
| 6        | Close the issue.                            | Issue status changes to "Closed". |

## 3. Automation Approach

### Tests to Automate
```
- Smoke Tests: Verify core functionalities like login, repository creation.
- Regression Tests: Ensure new updates do not break existing features.
- API Testing: Automate REST API validation for repositories and issues.
```

### Sample Automated Test Script (Cypress - JavaScript)

```javascript
describe('Repository Creation', () => {
  it('should allow a user to create a new repository', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('#username').type('testuser');
    cy.get('#password').type('password123');
    cy.get('#login-button').click();
    
    cy.contains('New Repository').click();
    cy.get('#repo-name').type('Test Repository');
    cy.get('#repo-description').type('This is a test repository.');
    cy.get('#create-repo-button').click();
    
    cy.contains('Test Repository').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

### Framework Choice
**Cypress:** Fast, reliable, and integrates well with CI/CD.
**Maintainability:** Tests are readable, modular, and reusable.

## 4. Bug Reporting & Tracking

### Bug Reporting Process
```
Identify and document the bug.

Assign severity and priority.

Report in a tracking system (JIRA, GitHub Issues).

Developers fix and push updates.

QA verifies and closes the issue.
```

### Sample Bug Report Template
```
- Title: Issue Creation Fails When Title Contains Special Characters

- Description: When creating an issue, if the title contains special characters (&, %, $), the issue fails to save.

- Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to an existing repository.
2. Click "New Issue".
3. Enter "Test & Issue" as the title.
4. Click "Submit".

- Expected Result: Issue should be created successfully.

- Actual Result: Error message appears, and issue is not created.
- Severity: High

- Environment: Staging
```

## 5. Additional Considerations

### CI/CD Integration
```
- Automated tests run on every pull request via GitHub Actions.
- Regression tests run on staging before production deployment.
- Bug fixes are verified before merging.
```

### Performance & Security Testing
```
- Load Testing: Simulate concurrent users to test response times.
- Security Checks: Validate authentication, prevent XSS/SQL injection.
